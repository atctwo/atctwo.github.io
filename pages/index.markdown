Hi, I'm Alex.  I like to work on little programming and electronics projects.  
You can find an archive of these projects on the [Projects](/projects/) page.  You can also find blog posts on the [Posts](/posts/) page.  There's more info about me on the [About](/about) page.

I hope you enjoy your stay here!
