Hello, I'm Alex!  This website is dedicated to cataloging the various projects I have worked on.  These range from small software utilities to electronic devices.  Most of what I've done is purely because it sounded fun, but I think that if I share my projects, someone might find something useful in them!  The website also hosts a blog where I talk about these topics.

My projects are collated on the [Projects](/projects/) page, and the blog can be accessed on the [Posts](/posts/) page.

I hope you enjoy your stay here!
