			Something potentially useful!<br>In my place of residence, 
			the only way to get the attention of someone who is on a 
			different floor than you is to shout to them. Someone			suggested using the <a style="color: rgb(0, 206, 209);" href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490710.aspx">net send</a>			command avaliable on MS-DOS to contact someone, since they were always			on their computer, but the computer was running Windows 10. So I			decided to make a thing based on net send, but instead of a computer			sending the message, a phone sends the message. <br><br>So here 
			is the project: it comes in two parts. There is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">client</span>, 
			which lies resident in memory on a computer, and waits for messages
			from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">server </span>which			exists in the form of an app. Not mush else to it, apart from the			fact that it uses UDP, so the devices must be on the same network.			Oh, and the sender can prompt the recipient to reply, should they			choose.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Downloads!</span><br><br>The			client is only for Windows at the moment, but I am working on porting			it to macOS and Linux. The server is only for Android, and I			don't really have plans for porting it to iOS.<br><br>Client: 
			ver1.1<br>
			<a style="color: rgb(0, 206, 209);" href="netmsg_client_win64_1_1.zip">win64</a> 12661kb zip file<br> 
			win32 (soon!)???kb<br><br>
			Server: ver 1.0<br>
			<a style="color: rgb(0, 206, 209);" href="netmsgapp1.0.apk">android apk</a>1331kb apk file<br><br>
