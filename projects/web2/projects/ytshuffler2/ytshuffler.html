		<h1>YouTube Playlist Shuffler</h1>
		<p>The function of this tool is pretty self-explanatory.  You provide a YouTube playlist URL, and it will pick a random video, and play it.  I can't remember when 
		   I first had this idea, but I decided to make it one day when my iPod died, and was forced to hastily put together a YouTube playlist of songs I like.  The mobile app
		   doesn't provide a shuffling freature (as of time of writing), so I made my own.  It was only after making this that I discovered that the new YouTube desktop
		   layout has a shuffle button.<br><br></p>
		<p><b>How to use:</b><br>
		   1) Copy a YouTube playlist URL.  The playlist must not be private, and must actually exist.  You can use unlisted playlists.<br>
		   2) Paste it in to the box below.<br>
		   3) Ckeck the Autoplay checkbox if you want the video to start straight away.<br>
		   4) Press "Go!" to shuffle the playlist, and play a song.<br>
		   5) Refrest the page, or press the "Shuffle!" button to get a new song.  It's random, so you may get the same song twice (or more) in a row.<br>
		   Enjoy the randomness!<br></p>
