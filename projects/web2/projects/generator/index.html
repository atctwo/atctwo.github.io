		<h2>Generator thing</h2>
		<p>Version 2.</p>
		<button onclick="location.href='../index.html'">Back to projects</button>
		<p>This tool allows you to generate a random string from "sets" of predetermined words.  For example, if you wanted a phrase 
		to be generated that said "Bob", "Joe", or "Steve", followed by "is cool" or "is uncool", you can use this tool to randomly 
		select words and put them together.</p>
		<p>Small bug: you have to drag and drop something at least once for this to work.</p>
		
		<button class="accordion">Show help</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>The tool works on the concept of "generators" and "conjunctives".  Generators tell the program to pick one phrase from a list
			of phrases randomly.  Conjunctives tell the program to use one set phase.  The program joins up the phrases in a set order, with spaces
			between each phrase.  You can drag and drop generators and conjunctives to rearrange the order in which resultant phrases are 
			assembled.  You can remove a generator or conjunctive entirely by pressing the "Remove generator/conjunctive" button.</p>
			<p>If you want to save a setup or configuration to a local file, and load it at a later data, the "Save config" button allows you
			to save your configuration as a file.  The "Load config" button allows you to upload a config that was saved earlier.</p>
			<p>Please avoid using commas (,) and colons (:) in phrases.  However, it is fine to use these if you have no intention of saving your config.</p>
