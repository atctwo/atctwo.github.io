			One night I was bored, and wanted to do something.  Why not play Breakout? 
			That game with the ball and coloured blocks that I realy like.  
			I was on my phone, so I searched Google Play for a Breakout clone, 
			and I could not find one that was as faithful to the original as I
			would have liked.  So, I made my own clone.  This is it.  I  made it
			in GameMaker: Studio, and for convenience, I exported it as HTML5 so 
			that I could play it online, but I originally developed it as an app.  
			So here it is; have fun!
			</br></br>
			TL;DR</br>A Breakout clone</br>
