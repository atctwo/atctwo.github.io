                An online game based on the ITV programme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chase_(British_game_show)">The Chase</a><br><br>

                This game only focuses on the head to head parts of the show.  That is, there is no Cash Builder or Final Chase.  There is a table with seven
                steps.  You and the Chaser have to answer a multiple choice question.  Once either person picks an answer, the other person has five seconds
                to pick their answer, otherwise they will be locked out, and unable to answer.  If you get the answer right, you move down the table ("closer to home").
                How far you are is shown in <span style="color: cyan;">cyan</span>.  If the Chaser gets the question right, they move closer to you.  The 
                Chaser's steps are shown in <span style="color: red;">red</span>.  If you make it down the whole table, you beat the Chaser, and you win.  If
                the Chaser catches up with you, you lose.<br><br>
                
                In this game, the Chaser's decisions are randomly chosen, but the outcome is still weighted.  The Chaser has a high chance of getting the 
                answer right.<br><br>

                The game is written entirely in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.  Functions to generate random stuff are from <a href="https://chancejs.com/">Chance.js</a>.
                The questions are fetched from the <a href="https://opentdb.com/">Open Trivia Database</a> using XMLHttpRequests.  The audio was downloaded from
				<a href="https://www.sounds-resource.com/mobile/thechase/sound/6064/">The Sounds Resource</a>.<br><br>

                This was developed in three days, and wasn't designed to look <em>exactly</em> like The Chase, so it might not be very visually appealing.  It was
                developed on a desktop computer, so it probably won't look very good on a mobile device.<br><br>

                Have fun!<br><br><br>
