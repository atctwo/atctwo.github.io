note:

- aria accessability

pagination
- theme has support for paginator v1
  - add settings to config.yml
  - if you're using GitHub Pages you need to add the pagination stuff to your site's _config.yml since Jekyll 3.9.3 doesn't include the configs of themes
- site uses paginator v2

tag page
- if you're using GitHub Pages (Jekyll 3.9.3), then tag pages won't work
  - they're generated by jekyll-archives, which is an external plugin
  - the site actually uses paginator-v2 which overrides these pages anyway
